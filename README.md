# Rolling-Render-Engine
This is a Rendering Engine written in C++, OpenGL and GLSL (using Shaders)

This has stolen code lmao.
I will probably rewrite this in Vulkan once I'm finished with fixing a bunch of bugs and adding alot of features.

Btw don't get jump scared cuz there is a bug where when you turn around you can see a copy of the objects from behind (it's not a copy because that
are the objects from behind somehow)

I am planning to write an entirely new renderer once I'm done with this project.
This was just to learn to get Ray Tracing working on the GPU using Compute Shaders and I'm planning to get into Vulkan for the rewritten Engine.

- [+] Global Illumination
- [+] More Material properties

This probably has alot of useless or messy stuff cuz this is just a POC! I'm not gonna fix any of this but continue to the next Project!

I'm gonna work on a Vulkan rewrite, with alot more features (which is suppost to be used in a demo)
Keep in mind, that this Ray Tracer is not suppost to be a replacement for anything!
It's just a fun project I started, because I wanted to see how far I could push my Hardware to the Limit,
without having to rely on RT Cores (cuz my GPU doesn't have RT Cores). I already have an Idea in mind,
which would allow me to get a less noisy image (not just ReSTIR but a Technique I thought of myself!)

k bye
