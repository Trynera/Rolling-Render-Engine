# Rolling-Render-Engine
This is a Rendering Engine written in C++, OpenGL and GLSL (using Shaders)

This has stolen code lmao.
I will probably rewrite this in Vulkan once I'm finished with fixing a bunch of bugs and adding alot of features.

Btw don't get jump scared cuz there is a bug where when you turn around you can see a copy of the objects from behind (it's not a copy because that
are the objects from behind somehow)

I am planning to write an entirely new renderer once I'm done with this project.
This was just to learn to get Ray Tracing working on the GPU using Compute Shaders and I'm planning to get into Vulkan for the rewritten Engine.

For now I'm just gonna add a few more Features like:
- [ ] HDR Support
- [ ] Global Illumination
- [ ] More Material properties
- [ ] ReSTIR
- [ ] Predetermined Indirect Illumination

k bye
